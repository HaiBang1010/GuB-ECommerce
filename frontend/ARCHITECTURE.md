# GuB Frontend — Architecture

Next.js **App Router** on Vercel. Overall system architecture: see [`../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md).

---

## 1. Foundational principles

- The frontend talks only to the **backend (Render)** over a REST API. It does **NOT** access the DB or Stripe secrets directly from the browser.
- The public storefront is browsable **without login**; login is required only at checkout.
- Every UI string goes through **next-intl** (vi/en) — never hardcode language in a component.
- **Light theme only.**

## 2. Directory structure (actual, Phase 3 — `features/` by domain)

Code is organised **by domain feature**, not by technical layer. Each domain owns its
`{components,hooks,api}/`; admin is kept **separate** from the storefront business domains
(an admin area is not a "domain"). Only genuinely shared leaves stay in `components/`, and
`lib/api/` holds infra only — domain fetchers live in `features/<domain>/api/`.

```

└── middleware.ts                 # i18n locale + Supabase session refresh + protect /checkout, /account, /admin
```

The admin area lives in a `[locale]/(admin)/admin/` route group with its own shell; the storefront
`Header` sits in a sibling `[locale]/(storefront)/` group (route groups are URL-transparent, so
customer URLs are unchanged). See §10. There is no `app/api/` BFF layer; the browser calls the
NestJS backend directly (CORS-open in dev).

**Cross-feature edges (intentional, type-only or admin-embedded):** `OrderStatus` + core order types
are canonical in `features/order/api/orders.ts`; the shared `order-status-badge`, `features/admin/orders`
and `features/admin/users` type-import them. The admin review fetcher (`features/admin/reviews/api`)
type-imports `Review` from `features/review/api`. The admin reply form
(`features/admin/reviews/components/admin-reply-form`) is embedded (admin-gated) on the storefront
product page — one deliberate storefront→admin edge.

## 3. State management

- **Server state (data from the backend):** TanStack Query — cache, invalidate, retry. No scattered `fetch` calls inside components.
- **Client state:** Zustand for the **guest cart** (persisted to localStorage). When the user logs in → **merge** the guest cart into the server cart (sum quantities, dedupe identical variants); after the merge, the server cart is the source of truth.
- Forms: react-hook-form + **zod** schema (kept in sync with the backend DTO types where shareable).

## 4. i18n

- next-intl with a `[locale]` prefix. Catalog in `messages/vi.json` + `messages/en.json`.
- Bilingual product content comes from the backend (`name_vi`/`name_en`) — the frontend picks based on the current locale.
- The admin product form has **two inputs** for each content field (vi/en).

## 5. Admin & RBAC

- The `/admin` route group hides UI by role, **but** all real protection lives on the backend (role guard). The frontend is only a convenience layer.
- Middleware checks the session before entering `/admin`; the backend is still the real gatekeeper.

## 6. Payments

- Use `@stripe/stripe-js` + Elements with the **publishable key**. Get the `clientSecret` from the backend, confirm the payment on the client.
- The **secret** key is never on the frontend.
- **Durable payment page** `/[locale]/account/orders/[id]/pay` (its own URL, not an inline checkout step): on every mount it re-fetches the `clientSecret` from the order id via the idempotent `POST /payments/intent`, so a refresh / tab-switch / revisit lands back on a working card field instead of losing it. Shared by checkout (new order) and pay-again. Guards by order status (PAID → confirmation, CANCELLED → notice). The webhook is the source of truth; the confirmation page polls `useOrder` until the status flips.
- **Stock vs. payment at checkout:** a place-order **409** (`OUT_OF_STOCK`) is shown as a per-item "only N left" message and refreshes the cart — distinct from a real payment error; the cart blocks checkout while any line exceeds live stock (auto-capping over-stock lines).
- `apiFetch` **swallows request cancellations** (an `AbortError` from a query whose page navigated away) instead of surfacing them as runtime errors, while still reporting genuine network failures.

## 7. Performance & SEO

- Product pages: SSR/SSG for SEO (Phase 7). Images: use `next/image`, webp format.
- Visitor analytics: **Vercel Web Analytics** (not inferred from order data).
- Admin charts: Recharts, data from the backend's aggregate API.

## 8. Reviews (Phase 3)

Purchased-only reviews surface in two existing pages (no new route):
- **Order detail** (`features/order/components/order-detail-view.tsx`) — a `DELIVERED` order renders a
  write/edit review block **per distinct product** (the backend allows one review per product,
  not per line item). The user's existing review is found by matching their id against the
  product's public review list (`useProductReviews`), since the order payload carries no review
  back-reference. Interactive `StarRating` + `Textarea`; `useCreateReview` / `useUpdateReview`
  invalidate `['reviews', productId]`.
- **Product detail** (`features/product/components/product-detail-view.tsx`) — a public rating summary
  (half-star average + count) and review list, each with a **"Verified buyer"** badge (the API
  exposes only `userId`, no name) and a **"Store reply"** block when `adminReply` is present.

Data layer: the customer fetchers/hooks (`features/review/api/reviews.ts` + `features/review/hooks/use-reviews.ts`)
and the admin reply fetcher/hook (`features/admin/reviews/{api/reviews.ts,hooks/use-admin-reviews.ts}`);
the shared `components/star-rating.tsx` + `ui/textarea.tsx`, and the `reviews` i18n namespace. The reply *display* (the "Store reply"
block) ships for everyone; **admin reply input** now ships too — an inline `AdminReplyForm` shown to an
admin under each review without a reply (`POST /admin/reviews/:id/reply`), available **both** on the
storefront product page and on the dedicated `/admin/reviews` list-all page (§10).

## 9. Notifications (Phase 3)

A bell in the header (`features/notification/components/notification-bell.tsx`), shown for logged-in users only.
`useNotifications` (`features/notification/hooks/use-notifications.ts`) fetches the list + `unreadCount`, gated by the
auth store and polling every 60s (no realtime until Phase 6). The badge shows the unread count; the
shadcn `DropdownMenu` lists items, each rendering its text from the structured `type` + `payload.orderId`
via the `notification` i18n namespace — **never** a stored string — linking to `/account/orders/[id]` and
marking itself read on select (`useMarkNotificationRead`), plus a "mark all read" action
(`useMarkAllNotificationsRead`). Both mutations invalidate `['notifications']`. The backend is the
producer (the single async path, backend §4.8); the frontend only reads + acks.

## 10. Admin (Phase 3)

The admin area is a `[locale]/(admin)/admin/` route group with its own client `AdminLayout` (an admin
topbar + a sidebar: **Orders · Users · Reviews · Vouchers · Sales · Categories** are wired, with
**Analytics** still a "coming soon" placeholder) — separate from the `[locale]/(storefront)/` group that
renders the storefront `Header`.
Route groups don't affect the URL, so every customer route is unchanged.

**Role is the single source of truth from the backend.** `Providers` calls `GET /me` (which returns
`iam.User.role`) on the initial session and on a **genuine `SIGNED_IN` (a new user id)**, storing `role`
in the auth store (cleared on `SIGNED_OUT`); there is **no** Supabase-metadata role sync. The
new-user-id guard matters: supabase-js **re-emits `SIGNED_IN` on every tab refocus**, and re-running the
role sync would flip `roleStatus` back to `loading` → the layout's `resolving` guard would unmount the
page mid-edit (an open Sheet/form is lost). The guard makes a same-user re-emit a no-op (it also skips a
redundant guest-cart merge). `isAdmin(role)` gates the Header's
Admin link and the layout. The client guard is a **convenience** — it waits for the auth store to
settle, then redirects a non-admin. The real protection is twofold: `middleware.ts` requires a
session to enter `/admin` (guests → login), and the backend **`RoleGuard`** rejects every `/admin/*`
API call from a non-admin (403). A wrong client-side guess can never bypass it.

**Orders** (`/admin/orders`): `useAdminOrders` fetches a **paginated** page (`GET /admin/orders`); each
row shows the order id, the **customer** (name + email, enriched server-side via `UserService` — a
service call, **no cross-module JOIN**), a status badge, the total, and a status-advance button
(PAID→PROCESSING→SHIPPED→DELIVERED via `POST /admin/orders/:id/status`; the frontend only picks the next
step, the backend enforces the legal transition). The toolbar adds a **multi-status checkbox filter**, a
**debounced unified search** (order id / customer name / email), and a **rows-per-page + windowed pager**
(`page`/`pageSize` + `total`, `keepPreviousData` so paging doesn't flash); any filter/search/page-size
change resets to page 1. Clicking an order id opens a shared **order-detail dialog** (`useAdminOrderDetail`
→ `GET /admin/orders/:id`: full items, shipping snapshot, status timeline, customer, and the advance-status
action). For a refundable order (`PAID`/`PROCESSING`/`SHIPPED`) the dialog also shows a destructive
**Refund** button (`useRefundOrder` → `POST /admin/orders/:id/refund`) behind a `window.confirm`; the
backend issues the Stripe refund, conditionally restocks, and flips the order to `REFUNDED` (ARCHITECTURE.md
§4.13). On success the list/detail/user queries invalidate and the status badge (which already maps
`REFUNDED`) updates. The customer cell links to the **user-detail page** at `/admin/users/[id]`.

**Users** (`/admin/users` + `/admin/users/[id]`): the list (`useAdminUsers` → `GET /admin/users`) is
paginated with a debounced name/email search; each row links to the detail page. The detail page
(`useAdminUser` → `GET /admin/users/:id`) is composed **in-process, never a cross-schema JOIN**: identity +
profile + address book from iam, **order stats + recent orders** from the order module (`OrderModule`
exports `OrderService`; iam imports it — acyclic). The stats card shows total orders, **total spent**
(only money actually collected — `PAID`/`PROCESSING`/`SHIPPED`/`DELIVERED`; `PENDING_PAYMENT`,
`CANCELLED` and `REFUNDED` are excluded), and a per-status breakdown (`byStatus` counts **every** status).
Recent orders open the same shared order-detail dialog.

**Reviews** (`/admin/reviews`): `useAdminReviews` (`GET /admin/reviews`) lists **every** review, paginated
and enriched with product name + reviewer identity, with an **all / unreplied / replied** filter. A review
with no reply shows an inline `AdminReplyForm` (`POST /admin/reviews/:id/reply`); the same form is **also**
embedded (admin-gated) on the storefront product detail (§8), so an admin can reply from either place.

**Vouchers** (`/admin/vouchers`): `useAdminVouchers` (`GET /admin/vouchers`) — paginated list with a
debounced code search. **New / Edit** open a right-side **Sheet** (`components/ui/sheet.tsx`, a hand-built
Radix Dialog wrapper) holding an RHF + zod form with the full field set, incl. the **two inputs per
content field** (`titleVi/En`, `descriptionVi/En`) and `PERCENT`/`FIXED` + public/wallet `<select>`s
(no shadcn Select primitive yet). Money inputs are integer cents. Archive is a soft delete. A **grant
panel** — shown **only for wallet-only vouchers** (`isPublic === false`; public ones need no grant) —
grants by **email** (`POST /admin/vouchers/:id/grant`) and lists the granted users with their used/unused
state (`GET /admin/vouchers/:id/grants`). The **user-detail page** (`/admin/users/[id]`) shows a
copy-to-clipboard **user id** for cross-referencing.

**Sales** (`/admin/sales`): a minimal sale-price manager (`features/admin/sales/`) — **not** a full
catalog CRUD. `useAdminProducts` (`GET /admin/products`) lists every product (incl. archived); a
client-side name search filters the (unpaginated, small) catalog. Each row shows base + current sale
price and an integer-cents input with **Save** / **Clear** → `useSetProductSale` (`PATCH
/admin/products/:id { salePriceCents }`, number sets / `null` clears). The backend re-validates
`sale < base` and the 400 message surfaces via a toast. The sale itself is applied at checkout by the
backend (ARCHITECTURE.md §4.11); this page is only the input surface.

**Categories** (`/admin/categories`): a full catalog-category manager (`features/admin/categories/`).
`useAdminCategories` (`GET /admin/categories`) lists every category (incl. archived) with active
product/sub-category **counts**, rendered as an **indented tree** (depth from the `parentId` chain) with a
client-side name/slug search. Each row has an **inline `sizeSystem` `<select>`** (PATCH on change — the
quick path to drive the size suggestion, §14) and **Archive/Restore** (the archive confirm **warns** the
counts it would hide; archive is a reversible soft-hide, never a delete). **New/Edit** open a right-side
**Sheet** (`category-form.tsx`, RHF+zod) with a **parent `<select>`** (self + descendants excluded to avoid
a cycle; the backend re-guards) and the `sizeSystem` picker. Any change invalidates `['admin','categories']`
+ `['size-suggestion']`. This wired **Categories** tab replaces the old "Catalog" placeholder.

## 11. Vouchers at checkout (Phase 4)

The storefront voucher lives inline in the checkout order summary (`features/voucher/` +
`features/checkout/components/checkout-view.tsx`) — no new route. A code input + **Apply** calls
`POST /vouchers/preview` (`useVoucherPreview`), which validates against the user's **live server cart**
and returns the discount; the summary then shows `subtotal / discount −X / total`, the applied voucher's
**title by locale** (fallback its code) and a **Remove** action. Placing the order passes the
`voucherCode` to `POST /orders`; the **backend re-validates + redeems** it (the preview is non-binding —
the discounted total is the backend's, ARCHITECTURE.md §4.10). A structured voucher error (`code` →
i18n message: not found / expired / min-order / used-up / user-limit / not-available) is rendered
distinctly from the out-of-stock 409 and a generic payment error, both at preview time and if the voucher
becomes invalid between preview and place-order. The customer **wallet** UI now ships at
`/account/vouchers` (§13). All strings go through the `voucher` (storefront) + `admin` (admin)
next-intl namespaces (vi/en).

## 12. Product discounts — storefront display (Phase 4)

The sale is computed on the **backend** (the effective price, ARCHITECTURE.md §4.11); the frontend
only renders it. The display is **sale-aware everywhere a price shows**:

- **Product card** (`features/product/components/product-card.tsx`) — shipped in Phase 1: `salePriceCents`
  vs struck-through `basePriceCents` + a red "Sale" badge.
- **Product detail** (`product-detail-view.tsx`) — now mirrors the backend rule: the shown price is
  `salePriceCents < variant.priceCents ? salePriceCents : variant.priceCents` (per selected variant, or
  the lowest across variants for the `From …` label), with the pre-sale price struck through + the badge
  when discounted.
- **Cart** (`cart-view.tsx`) — shows the backend's `unitPriceCents` (already the effective price) and
  strikes through `compareAtCents` (the pre-sale unit price, `null` when not on sale) sent on each cart
  line. No client-side price math.

The "Sale" badge label lives in the `product` + `Products` next-intl namespaces (vi/en).

## 13. Account section & wallet (Phase 4)

The customer's "my" pages live under a single `/account` route group inside `(storefront)`
(a URL-transparent group → a real `/account` URL segment):

- **Orders moved** `/orders/*` → `/account/orders/*` (`page` · `[id]` · `[id]/pay` ·
  `[id]/confirmation`, plain `git mv` of the thin route wrappers). Every customer reference was
  repointed: the locale-aware `Link`/`router` calls in `features/order/*` + `features/checkout`,
  the notification-bell deep-link (§9), the header "My orders" item, and — critically — the Stripe
  `confirmPayment` **`return_url`** in `order-payment.tsx` (the one absolute URL that hardcodes the
  `/${locale}` prefix → now `…/account/orders/[id]/confirmation`). Admin `/admin/orders` is a
  **different** route group and is unchanged.
- **Wallet** `/account/vouchers` (`features/voucher/hooks/use-wallet-vouchers` +
  `components/wallet-view.tsx`): an auth-gated `useQuery(['wallet-vouchers'])` (mirror of
  `useNotifications`, gated on the auth store, **no polling**) reads `GET /me/vouchers` and renders
  each grant as a card — locale title (fallback `code`), discount (PERCENT `value%` / FIXED money via
  `formatPriceCents`), min-order / max-discount / valid-until, the per-user **uses-left**
  (`perUserLimit − userUsedCount`, "Unlimited" when uncapped), and a **copy-code** button (mirror of
  the admin `CopyableId` — inline 1.5s feedback, swallows insecure-context clipboard failures).
  The **valid-until** deadline shows `deadline = v.expiresAt ?? v.validTo`: the per-user `expiresAt`
  (e.g. the birthday voucher = grant + 30d, backend §4.14) takes precedence over the voucher's own
  `validTo`. No "expired" badge — the backend already hides a grant once its `expiresAt` is past (mirrors
  `validTo`), so any shown deadline is still in the future. Read-only — applying a voucher still happens
  at checkout (§11).
- **Profile** `/account/profile` (`features/profile/`): an auth-gated `useProfile` (`GET /me/profile`)
  feeds an RHF+zod form (`profile-form.tsx`) — a **birthday** (native `<input type="date">`, `max`=today,
  round-tripped `YYYY-MM-DD` ↔ the backend ISO `DateTime`) + height/weight + body measurements
  (chest/waist/hip/footLength, all optional) saved via `PATCH /me/profile` (`useUpdateProfile` invalidates
  `['profile']` + `['size-suggestion']`). Measurements power the size suggestion (§14); the birthday powers
  the birthday-voucher cron (backend §4.14) — it's stored on `iam.User`, surfaced through the same
  `/me/profile` endpoint.
- **Landing** `/account` — a minimal index linking Orders + Vouchers + Profile.
- **Gate:** `middleware.ts` `PROTECTED` now matches `/account` (replacing `/orders`) so the whole
  `/account/*` subtree requires a session (guests → login).
- **i18n / header:** new `wallet` + `account` next-intl namespaces (vi/en); the header's "Vouchers"
  dropdown item (previously a disabled "coming soon") now links to `/account/vouchers`. A **Profile** item
  (`nav.profile`) was added beside it.

## 14. Size suggestion on the product page (Phase 4)

The product detail page shows a **rule-based suggested size** for logged-in users — the backend computes
it (ARCHITECTURE.md §4.12); the FE only renders. `features/product/api/size-suggestion.ts` +
`hooks/use-size-suggestion.ts` (an auth-gated `useQuery(['size-suggestion', slug])` that never fires for
guests) call `GET /products/:slug/size-suggestion`. In `product-detail-view.tsx` `DetailContent` (which
now also reads `useAuthStore`), a `<SuggestedSize/>` block sits by the size selector and renders by status:
- `SUGGESTED` → "Suggested for you: {size}" (+ a `SNUG`/`PERFECT`/`LOOSE` fit note) with a button that
  calls `setSelectedSize(size)`;
- `NO_PROFILE` → "Add your measurements", linking to `/account/profile`;
- `NO_CHART` / `NO_MATCH` / guest → renders nothing.
Suggestion strings live in the `product` namespace; the profile form/page strings in a new `profile`
namespace (vi/en).
