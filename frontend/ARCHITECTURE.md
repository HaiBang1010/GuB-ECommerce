# GuB Frontend — Architecture

Next.js **App Router** on Vercel. Overall system architecture: see [`../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md).

---

## 1. Foundational principles

- The frontend talks only to the **backend (Render)** over a REST API. It does **NOT** access the DB or Stripe secrets directly from the browser.
- The public storefront is browsable **without login**; login is required only at checkout.
- Every UI string goes through **next-intl** (vi/en) — never hardcode language in a component.
- **Light theme only.**

## 2. Directory structure (actual, Phase 2)

```
src/
├── app/[locale]/                 # next-intl: /vi, /en
│   ├── page.tsx                  # home
│   ├── products/                 # grid + [slug] detail
│   ├── cart/                     # server cart (guest + user)
│   ├── checkout/                 # address + place order → redirects to the pay page
│   ├── orders/                   # list · [id] detail+timeline · [id]/pay (durable payment) · [id]/confirmation
│   ├── auth/                     # login · signup · callback
│   └── providers.tsx, layout.tsx # QueryClient + Supabase session bridge + <Toaster>
├── components/                   # page views + ui/ (hand-written shadcn primitives)
├── hooks/                        # TanStack Query hooks (use-cart, use-orders, use-addresses, …)
├── lib/api/                      # apiFetch client, committed schema.d.ts, per-resource fetchers
├── lib/supabase/                 # browser / server / middleware clients
├── stores/                       # Zustand: auth + cart (guest sessionId + display snapshots)
├── i18n/ · messages/             # routing/navigation helpers + vi.json / en.json
└── middleware.ts                 # i18n locale + Supabase session refresh + protect /checkout, /orders
```

The admin route group (`/admin`) is **not built yet** — it lands Phase 3+. There is no `app/api/`
BFF layer; the browser calls the NestJS backend directly (CORS-open in dev).

## 3. State management

- **Server state (data from the backend):** TanStack Query — cache, invalidate, retry. No scattered `fetch` calls inside components.
- **Client state:** Zustand for the **guest cart** (persisted to localStorage). When the user logs in → **merge** the guest cart into the server cart (sum quantities, dedupe identical variants); after the merge, the server cart is the source of truth.
- Forms: react-hook-form + **zod** schema (kept in sync with the backend DTO types where shareable).

## 4. i18n

- next-intl with a `[locale]` prefix. Catalog in `messages/vi.json` + `messages/en.json`.
- Bilingual product content comes from the backend (`name_vi`/`name_en`) — the frontend picks based on the current locale.
- The admin product form has **two inputs** for each content field (vi/en).

## 5. Admin & RBAC

- The `/admin` route group hides UI by role, **but** all real protection lives on the backend (role guard). The frontend is only a convenience layer.
- Middleware checks the session before entering `/admin`; the backend is still the real gatekeeper.

## 6. Payments

- Use `@stripe/stripe-js` + Elements with the **publishable key**. Get the `clientSecret` from the backend, confirm the payment on the client.
- The **secret** key is never on the frontend.
- **Durable payment page** `/[locale]/orders/[id]/pay` (its own URL, not an inline checkout step): on every mount it re-fetches the `clientSecret` from the order id via the idempotent `POST /payments/intent`, so a refresh / tab-switch / revisit lands back on a working card field instead of losing it. Shared by checkout (new order) and pay-again. Guards by order status (PAID → confirmation, CANCELLED → notice). The webhook is the source of truth; the confirmation page polls `useOrder` until the status flips.
- **Stock vs. payment at checkout:** a place-order **409** (`OUT_OF_STOCK`) is shown as a per-item "only N left" message and refreshes the cart — distinct from a real payment error; the cart blocks checkout while any line exceeds live stock (auto-capping over-stock lines).
- `apiFetch` **swallows request cancellations** (an `AbortError` from a query whose page navigated away) instead of surfacing them as runtime errors, while still reporting genuine network failures.

## 7. Performance & SEO

- Product pages: SSR/SSG for SEO (Phase 7). Images: use `next/image`, webp format.
- Visitor analytics: **Vercel Web Analytics** (not inferred from order data).
- Admin charts: Recharts, data from the backend's aggregate API.
